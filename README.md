# data_analytics

I've tried simple integration of Looker with Google Cloud Big Query. For the data source I used public IMBd data shared via Analytics hub. 

Hereâ€™s an example of a Looker dashboard visualization that analyzes the lifespan of individuals mentioned on IMDb in relation to video materials listed on the same site. The interactive dashboard can be viewed [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/embed/reporting/15deb2b7-387a-4cfd-9e1e-d1747ec0bafc/page/NFd8D) or byclicking on the image itself.
