1. I've tried simple integration of Looker with Google Cloud Big Query. For the data source I used public IMBd data shared via Analytics hub. 

Hereâ€™s an example of a Looker dashboard visualization that analyzes the lifespan of individuals mentioned on IMDb in relation to video materials listed on the same site. The interactive dashboard can be viewed [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/embed/reporting/15deb2b7-387a-4cfd-9e1e-d1747ec0bafc/page/NFd8D) or by clicking on the image itself.

Note: calculated field for Looker, D_age range:
```sql
CASE 
    WHEN [Lifespan] < 12 THEN '<12'
    WHEN [Lifespan] >= 12 AND [Lifespan] <= 18 THEN '12-18'
    WHEN [Lifespan] >= 19 AND [Lifespan] <= 25 THEN '19-25'
    WHEN [Lifespan] >= 26 AND [Lifespan] <= 45 THEN '26-45'
    WHEN [Lifespan] >= 46 AND [Lifespan] <= 69 THEN '46-69'
    WHEN [Lifespan] >= 70 AND [Lifespan] <= 89 THEN '70-89'
    WHEN [Lifespan] >= 90 AND [Lifespan] <= 99 THEN '90-99'
    ELSE '100+'
END
```


2. Did the same report for Tableau (with Google Cloud Big Query source).

The interactive dashboard can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tanya.saburova/viz/BigQuery_IMBD/Dashboard1?publish=yes) or by clicking on the image itself.

Note: calculated field for Tableau, d_age_range:
```
IF [Lifespan] < 12 THEN '<12'
  ELSEIF [Lifespan] >= 12 AND [Lifespan] <= 18 THEN '12-18'
  ELSEIF [Lifespan] >= 19 AND [Lifespan] <= 25 THEN '19-25'
  ELSEIF [Lifespan] >= 26 AND [Lifespan] <= 45 THEN '26-45'
  ELSEIF [Lifespan] >= 46 AND [Lifespan] <= 69 THEN '46-69'
  ELSEIF [Lifespan] >= 70 AND [Lifespan] <= 89 THEN '70-89'
  ELSEIF [Lifespan] >= 90 AND [Lifespan] <= 99 THEN '90-99'
  ELSE '100+'
END
```
